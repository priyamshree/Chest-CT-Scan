## Introduction

Chest cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification of cancerous lesions can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify chest cancer from medical images, particularly using techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Features
- Preprocessing of medical images
- Custom CNN architecture for chest cancer classification
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of training results (loss/accuracy curves)
- Model testing on new images

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled chest cancer images. For this project, we used publicly available datasets such as:
- [ChestX-ray8 Dataset](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC)
- Custom medical images sourced from various online databases

Please make sure to download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before proceeding.

## Installation

To run this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chest-cancer-classification.git
cd chest-cancer-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV (optional for image processing)

## Usage

To train the model on the dataset, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py --dataset data/chest_cancer --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```
For testing the model on new images:
```
python test.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```
## Configuration

You can adjust various parameters in the config.yaml file, including:
- Model architecture
- Learning rate
- Epochs and batch size
- Optimizer settings

## Model Architecture

The model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for medical image classification. The architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling, fully connected layers, and a softmax output layer.

- Convolutional Layers: Feature extraction
- Pooling Layers: Downsampling
- Fully Connected Layers: Classification

## Training

To train the model, we use cross-entropy loss and optimize the model using the Adam optimizer. The model is trained for 50 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001.
```
python train.py --dataset data/chest_cancer --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

## Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated on a test set. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed:
```
python evaluate.py --model path/to/model.h5 --dataset data/test
```

## Results
The results of the model are logged during training, and the performance on the test set is visualized as precision-recall curves, confusion matrices, etc.

Example Results:

Accuracy: 
Precision: 
Recall:
